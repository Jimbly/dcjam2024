Plan:
* 2 abilities per character
* roll 2 dice, choose 1 ability per die
* each ability _adds_ to rage/aggro
* monsters choose who to attack (everyone tied with most rage), do those attacks, then rage of targeted people drops in half

* Add a 7th wild face as you get more insane?

UX:
* select two abilities, all results are previewed, click confirm, animation quickly plays out?
* or, just choose one, on mouseover it previews the affect, and updates the previewed incoming damage, and does it (but doesn't let you accurately see where rage will be after the second action...)

Example:

Enemy:
Damage 5
Health: 15

Option 1:
  1 ability per character; roll 4, pick 2, doubles are wild
    had a lot more flexibility, seemed unlikely to die
Option 2:
  2 abilities per character; roll 2, use them, each die gets choice of 2 abilities (maybe doubles also wild)
    almost died; have to pay attention to Rage values - much more interesting if there are more identical values, so, range of just 1-4? 1-3?
    need more abilities for this, but, similar/same ability on a different rage slot is actually interesting
    rage _slots_ are only interesting if the rage applies for the whole turn, e.g. enemies choose targets, then attack, then rage decays


Ability effects:  Want room for 3 of these?
(always) + Rage
- Rage
Attack Front
Attack All
Attack Back
Shield Self (stacks)
Shield All (1 turn, doesn't stack)
Poison (Front? Back? All?)
Heal (lowest or choice?)
Heal All
Shield break (all?)
Drain Sanity (enemy ability only)
