Agenda
* visual style
  * fonts?
* realtime or turn based outside of combat?

TODO
* insanity
  * permanent damage (1 per death)
  * temp damage (10 per death, 1 per attack that damages?)
  * game over condition
* Rooms of Solitude
  * auto-save (also disable manual saving) upon enter and exit
  * restore sanity
* spend XP to level up skills or heroes
  * only in Rooms of Solitude
* monsters move around
* combat - maybe add log for enemy turn explaining what happened, press button to Roll! when done reading
  * probably don't need as much help text then?
* add a BACK type attack
* start balancing combat encounters
* medicine cabinet
  * restores max sanity after a choice
  * flavor text
* placeholder journal entries on a computer
* Get in-world monsters and battle sprites using the same source images (make this use a spritesheet!)
* Insanity view
  * party portraits to change to monsters - silhouettes
  * ghosts moving through the level
  * dark/postprocess - 16-bit color crunch?
* combat: unwinnable/losable combat: scale up damage of monsters / everyone every X turns?

Polish
* Add a [help] button on the combat screen that explains the basic mechanics
  * and/or just use the help area for "tooltips" during combat
  * explain hero ability icons: front/all/back
  * explain monster attack icons and aggro:
    * [img=attack_front_enemy] targets highest [img=aggro]AGGRO, divided by ties, rounded down
  * shields, aggro decay
* long-press on ability is not focusing and showing preview
  * also, make sure it all works well with controller
* scrolling starfield
